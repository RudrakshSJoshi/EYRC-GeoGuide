Please write the complete steps taken by your team explaining how you completed Task 2B. It is adviced to be as elaborate as possible.


1.	The essential libraries were imported to initiate the task.
2.	In the interest of consistent results, random seeds were set for the project.
3.	Proivded labels were given to the classes based on the description proivded to us.
4.	For the images, a fixed size was chosen(256 x 256 pixels), and the paths to the training and testing image data directories were fixed.
5.	The training and testing data was loaded with corresponding labels and added to the list.
6.	Some images were printed to verify proper loading of data.
7.	Following that, the data was transformed into NumPy arrays.
8.	To prepare for training and testing, the data was split accordingly.
9.	The pixel values of the images were normalized to fit the model.
10.	Data augmentation techniques were applied to better the model.
11.	A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model was crafted which included MaxPooling2D, Conv2D, Flatten, Dense, with appropriate activation functions such as ReLU and Softmax, etc.
12.	After the basis was set, the model was compiled with all the right settings.
13.	A bit of support and tuning was added to the model with introduction of early stopping and a learning rate scheduler.
14.	A custom callback was created to keep an eye on accuracy.
15.	The training phase was finally launched to create as accurate as possible of a model.
16.	Once the training was complete, the model's performance was evaluated.
17.	The misclassified examples were then taken for identification and evaluation.
18.	After identification, they were sorted and counted by class, and all the changes were taken into consideration.
19.	It was time to put the model to the test on new data and make predictions.
20.	Then the model was showcased by visualizing its predictions on fresh data.
21.	The model was downloaded and the weights were stored as data locally into the folder, with regular updation whenever a higher accuracy was achieved.
22.	Finally, relevant changes were made in consideration with the layout handed over by the eYantra webpage.
